# This is a placeholder file to ensure the directory exists and is recognized.
# The actual CRDs are generated by Bazel into this directory during build/test,
# but for Helm chart distribution they should be pre-generated or this directory
# should contain the source CRDs.
#
# Since we are using Bazel to generate CRDs into chart/templates/crds,
# we rely on the build process to populate this.
#
# However, to make the chart usable directly from source, we should probably
# make sure the CRDs are present.
# 
# For now, we will leave this empty and assume the user runs `bazel build //chart/templates/crds:crds`
# which populates this directory with YAML files.
